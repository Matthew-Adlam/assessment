<h1> Tips and tricks for level 1 Maths! </h1>

<ul>
<li>Show all working. I know its tedious and boring, but it will get you the marks.</li>
<li>State the final answer at the end of your working so it is clear for the marker.</li>
<li>For squares questions, remember that -12 is the square root of 144 aswell as 12. They have 2 answers, 1 positive and 1 negative.</li>
<li>ATBQ. Answer the Bloody Question, as stated by a certain math teacher, is a very helpful guide. Actually answer the question at the end ie. Bob has 1 apple remaining.</li>
